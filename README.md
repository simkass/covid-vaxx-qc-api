# 31/03/2022
Please note that this service is now disabled as the vaccination campaign in Qu√©bec is reaching its end.
GET Establishments is the only endpoint that still works for demonstration purposes on the web app.
The other endpoints will return 200 but won't do anything. Again just for demonstration purpose in the web app.
The notification service has been shut down. Nothing to change in the code.
